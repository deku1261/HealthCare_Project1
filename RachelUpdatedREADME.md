<p align="center"> Covid 19 Vaccination Data</p>

<p class = indent>Vaccination data is imperative to the safety and well-being of populations. Understanding the role of data within the healthcare field will help paint a broader picture of healthcare. Inturn, pivotal decisions that are driven by data points help CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, control health policy. Vaccination coverage across U.S. denotes the credibility and integrity of the healthcare field. Though there is much debate about the efficacy of vaccinations, data can help triangulate a truth driven and evidence based approach towards vaccinating populations. This became even more pertinent as the threat of a virus was eminent beginning March of 2020. Mortality from Covid-19 virus statistics were excluded from the dataset, yet further investigation is necessary to test efficacy, and track prevention of deaths. </p> 

<p class = indent>The question first begins with what percentage of the population has their vaccination series completed. Based on the data, we can see that the average series completion percentage increases over time (Figure 1). During 2021, the collection of series completion began. Due to the dataset being extremely large, filtering the data over monthly and yearly time axis is beneficial. Monthly and yearly datapoints were filtered from the original dataset as averages. On average, 2021, 2022, and 2023 vaccination series completion percentages were 26.84%, 51.01%, and 53.93% respectively (Figure 2). </p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public health and economies worldwide. As countries grapple with the challenges posed by the virus, the development and distribution of effective vaccines have emerged as crucial tools in controlling its spread. The United States of America, as one of the most affected nations, has played a significant role in the global vaccination effort. Data was acquired by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding the COVID-19 vaccines administered in the United States. 


The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines plays a crucial role in achieving widespread immunization and controlling the spread of the virus. In this study, we examined data obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the vaccination rates in different regions of the United States. Our findings revealed a significant disparity between the metro and non-metro areas in terms of vaccine uptake. Utilizing a pie chart, we visualized the distribution of vaccinated individuals, with 45.5% residing in metro regions and 54.5% in non-metro regions. This discrepancy highlights the importance of targeted efforts to ensure equitable vaccine access and uptake in both urban and rural areas. Strategies such as mobile vaccination clinics, community outreach programs, and targeted messaging tailored to specific regional needs can help bridge this gap and ensure comprehensive vaccine coverage across the country.

Understanding the variation in COVID-19 vaccine administration across different states is crucial for assessing the progress and effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. To gain insights into this aspect, we analyzed the CDC data and created a bar graph showcasing the average COVID-19 vaccines administered in the top 10 states. This bar graph highlighted the variations in vaccine distribution among these states. The analysis revealed that certain states exhibited higher average vaccine administration rates compared to others. This disparity can be influenced by factors such as population size, vaccine allocation strategies, healthcare infrastructure, and public health initiatives. Identifying states with higher vaccination rates can serve as best practice examples for other regions, guiding policymakers and health authorities in implementing successful vaccination strategies. Moreover, this analysis underscores the need for targeted interventions and resource allocation to states with lower vaccination rates, ensuring an equitable distribution of vaccines and fostering nationwide immunization against COVID-19.
