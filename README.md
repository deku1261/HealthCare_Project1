<p align="center"> Covid 19 Vaccination Data</p>

<p class = indent>Vaccination data is imperative to the safety and well-being of populations. Understanding the role of data within the healthcare field will help paint a broader picture of healthcare. Inturn, pivotal decisions that are driven by data points help CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, control health policy. Vaccination coverage across U.S. denotes the credibility and integrity of the healthcare field. Though there is much debate about the efficacy of vaccinations, data can help triangulate a truth driven and evidence based approach towards vaccinating populations. This became even more pertinent as the threat of a virus was eminent beginning March of 2020. Mortality from Covid-19 virus statistics were excluded from the dataset, yet further investigation is necessary to test efficacy, and track prevention of deaths. </p> 

<p class = indent>The question first begins with what percentage of the population has their vaccination series completed. Based on the data, we can see that the average series completion percentage increases over time (Figure 1). During 2021, the collection of series completion began. Due to the dataset being extremely large, filtering the data over monthly and yearly time axis is beneficial. Monthly and yearly datapoints were filtered from the original dataset as averages. On average, 2021, 2022, and 2023 vaccination series completion percentages were 26.84%, 51.01%, and 53.93% respectively (Figure 2). </p>

Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccination by Age Groups from 2021 to 2023: A Comparative Analysis


The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented global health crisis, prompting the rapid development and deployment of vaccines. Vaccination campaigns play a pivotal role in curbing the transmission of the virus, protecting vulnerable individuals, and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. To assess the distribution of COVID-19 vaccination by age groups, data from the CDC were analyzed. The study population was divided into three age categories: 5 to 17, 18 to 64, and 65 and older. The percentage of individuals within each age group who had completed the series of the vaccine was calculated and compared. Analysis of the data revealed notable variations in vaccination coverage among the different age groups. Surprisingly, the age group 5 to 17 exhibited the highest vaccination percentage. This finding can be attributed to the prioritization of school-age children and adolescents in vaccination campaigns, aiming to safeguard educational settings and reduce the potential for virus transmission within this population. In contrast, the 65 and over age group demonstrated the lowest percentage of vaccinated individuals.


In 2021: 5 to 17 year olds who completed the series of vaccinations were 51% of the population while the 65 + was only 10%

In 2022: 5 to 17 year olds grew from 51% to 64% while the 65+ age group dropped from 10% to 7%

In 2023: there were no changes in the percentage although the number totals have drastically dropped.

The overall for each of the age groups from year to year

In September 2021 was the first round of Covid vaccinations so the data only shows 3 months of data.  Although at that time it was a rush to get as many people vaccinated as possible.  Mainly focusing on the school age group.  The 2022 data which is the only data that shows a full 12-month period.  Finally the 2023 data shows the same percentage as 2022 but the number of people fully vaccinated dropped.  The factors may include that it is showing the tail end of the Vaccinations and only 5 months of data.
