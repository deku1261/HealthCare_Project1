<p align="center"> Covid 19 Vaccination Data</p>

<t> </t>Vaccination data is imperative to the safety and well-being of populations. Understanding the role of data within the healthcare field will help paint a broader picture of healthcare. Inturn, pivotal decisions that are driven by data points help CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, control health policy. Vaccination coverage across U.S. denotes the credibility and integrity of the healthcare field. Though there is much debate about the efficacy of vaccinations, data can help triangulate a truth driven and evidence based approach towards vaccinating populations. This became even more pertinent as the threat of a virus was eminent beginning March of 2020. Mortality from Covid-19 virus statistics were excluded from the dataset, yet further investigation is necessary to test efficacy, and track prevention of deaths.
  
<t> </t>The question first begins with what percentage of the population has their vaccination series completed. Based on the data, we can see that the average series completion percentage increases over time (Figure 1). During 2021, the collection of series completion began. Due to the dataset being extremely large, filtering the data over monthly and yearly time axis is beneficial. Monthly and yearly datapoints were filtered from the original dataset as averages. On average, 2021, 2022, and 2023 vaccination series completion percentages were 26.84%, 51.01%, and 53.93% respectively (Figure 2).
