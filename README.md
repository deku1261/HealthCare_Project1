Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccination by Age Groups from 2021 to 2023: A Comparative Analysis


The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented global health crisis, prompting the rapid development and deployment of vaccines. Vaccination campaigns play a pivotal role in curbing the transmission of the virus, protecting vulnerable individuals, and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. To assess the distribution of COVID-19 vaccination by age groups, data from the CDC were analyzed. The study population was divided into three age categories: 5 to 17, 18 to 64, and 65 and older. The percentage of individuals within each age group who had completed the series of the vaccine was calculated and compared. Analysis of the data revealed notable variations in vaccination coverage among the different age groups. Surprisingly, the age group 5 to 17 exhibited the highest vaccination percentage. This finding can be attributed to the prioritization of school-age children and adolescents in vaccination campaigns, aiming to safeguard educational settings and reduce the potential for virus transmission within this population. In contrast, the 65 and over age group demonstrated the lowest percentage of vaccinated individuals.


In 2021: 5 to 17 year olds who completed the series of vaccinations were 51% of the population while the 65 + was only 10%

In 2022: 5 to 17 year olds grew from 51% to 64% while the 65+ age group dropped from 10% to 7%

In 2023: there were no changes in the percentage although the number totals have drastically dropped.

The overall for each of the age groups from year to year

In September 2021 was the first round of Covid vaccinations so the data only shows 3 months of data.  Although at that time it was a rush to get as many people vaccinated as possible.  Mainly focusing on the school age group.  The 2022 data which is the only data that shows a full 12-month period.  Finally the 2023 data shows the same percentage as 2022 but the number of people fully vaccinated dropped.  The factors may include that it is showing the tail end of the Vaccinations and only 5 months of data.
