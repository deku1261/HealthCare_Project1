Project 1 - Healthcare Data

  Vaccination data is imperative to the safety and well-being of populations. Understanding the role of data within the healthcare field will help paint a broader picture of healthcare. Inturn, pivotal decisions that are driven by data points help CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, control health policy. Vaccination coverage across U.S. denotes the credibility and integrity of healthcare field. Though there is much debate about the efficacy of vaccinations, data can help triangulate a truth driven and evidence based approach towards vaccinating the population. This became even more pertinent as the threat of a virus was eminent beginning March of 2020. Mortality from Covid-19 virus statistics were excluded from the dataset, yet further investigation is necessary to test efficacy, and track prevention of deaths.
